This chapter provides an overview of recent research that uses eye movements to investigate both spoken language comprehension and language production. Issues of data analysis and linking hypotheses are addressed in what is now commonly referred to as the “visual world” paradigm, including issues that arise in comparing results to those from eye-tracking reading studies. Psycholinguists now use the visual-world eye-movement method to study both language production and language comprehension. Eye movements are a response measure of choice for studies addressing many classical questions about spoken language processing in psycholinguistics. Many of the most widely used tasks for studying spoken language comprehension present only a snapshot of processing at a single point in time, require meta-linguistic judgments, and interrupt the flow of the speech input. In contrast, eye movements provide a sensitive, implicit measure of spoken language processing in which the response is closely time-locked to the input without interrupting the speech stream. The eye movement paradigm can be used with simple natural tasks such as picking up and moving objects, making it well suited for studies with young children and with special populations. The paradigm allows one to study real-time language production and comprehension in natural tasks involving conversational interaction.}

We are generally not consciously aware of the complex cognitive operations that underlie these processes. However, researchers have been able to learn a great deal about these operations by using methods such as eyetracking during reading and recording of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). This chapter provides a broad overview of some of the main theoretical issues and empirical conclusions in this area, focusing on the following questions: How rapidly do we perform syntactic and semantic analysis in the course of reading? Do we construct more than one syntactic analysis at a time? Does syntactic analysis always precede semantic interpretation? What role does memory play in sentence processing? Finally, how do these sentence-level processes relate to the process of visual word recognition itself?}",

We then describe some factors that account for variability in eye movement variables and then discuss some important methodological paradigms (namely gaze-contingent display change paradigms) that have contributed to our knowledge about eye movements and cognitive processing in reading. In particular, these paradigms have been used to study what types of information readers obtain from a word before they look directly at it. We review what we have learned from experiments using these paradigms. We also discuss the issue of eye movement control in reading (i.e., what determines where the eyes move and how long they linger on a particular word) and describe several studies demonstrating that eye movement control in reading is determined directly by ongoing cognitive process.}",
