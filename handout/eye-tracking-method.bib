This chapter provides an overview of recent research that uses eye movements to investigate both spoken language comprehension and language production. Issues of data analysis and linking hypotheses are addressed in what is now commonly referred to as the “visual world” paradigm, including issues that arise in comparing results to those from eye-tracking reading studies. Psycholinguists now use the visual-world eye-movement method to study both language production and language comprehension. Eye movements are a response measure of choice for studies addressing many classical questions about spoken language processing in psycholinguistics. Many of the most widely used tasks for studying spoken language comprehension present only a snapshot of processing at a single point in time, require meta-linguistic judgments, and interrupt the flow of the speech input. In contrast, eye movements provide a sensitive, implicit measure of spoken language processing in which the response is closely time-locked to the input without interrupting the speech stream. The eye movement paradigm can be used with simple natural tasks such as picking up and moving objects, making it well suited for studies with young children and with special populations. The paradigm allows one to study real-time language production and comprehension in natural tasks involving conversational interaction.}
